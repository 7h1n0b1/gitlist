I may attempt to move over to the new VM to finish out the training tomorrow. We can decide
as a class in the morning. In the mean time, use the following guide to remove the
troublesome version of Java and install a functional version on the original VM, not the one
we used for most of the day today. If you have any questions or issues, please contact me or
arrive early tomorrow and I can help. Have a good evening.

Remove old version of Java
==========================
sudo apt-get purge openjdk*

Install new version of Java
===========================
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer

Verify Java install
===================
java -version

Optional cleanup
================
sudo apt-get autoremove
